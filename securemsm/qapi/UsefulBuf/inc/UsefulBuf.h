/**

 The goal of this code is to make buffer and pointer manipulation
 easier and safer.

 The idea is that you use the UsefulBuf, UsefulOutBuf and UsefulInputBuf
 structures to represent buffers rather than ad hoc pointers and lengths.

 With these it will often be possible to write code that does little or no
 direct pointer manipulation for copying and formating data. For example
 the QCBOR encoder was rewritten using these and only one simple function
 remains that does any pointer manipulation.

 While it is true that object code using these functions will be a little
 larger and slower than a white-knuckle clever use of pointers might be, but
 not by that much or enough to have an affect for must use cases. For
 security-oriented code this is highly worthwhile. Clarity, simplicity,
 reviewability and certainty are more important.

 There are some extra sanity and double checks in this code to help catch
 coding errors and simple memory corruption. They are helpful, but not a
 substitute for proper code review, input validation and such.

 This code has a lot of simple small functions to hopefully create clarity
 about what it does so it is easier to review. UsefulOutBuf and UsefulInBuf
 are also objects in a form (a largely private data structure and accessor
 functions). Most of the code is marked inline and presumably compilers
 will do a good job on optimizing all this. (In theory they should, though
 this has not been verified yet).

/**

 UsefulBuf is a simple data structure to hold a pointer and length for
 a binary data.  In C99 this data structure can be passed on the stack
 making a lot of code cleaner than carrying around a pointer and
 length as two parameters.

 This is also conducive to secure code practice as the lengths are
 always carried with the the pointer and the convention for handling a
 pointer and a length is clear.

 While it might be possible to write buffer and pointer code more
 efficiently in some use cases, the thought is that unless there is an
 extreme need for performance (e.g. you are building a
 gigabit-per-second IP router), it is probably better to have cleaner
 code you can be most certain about the security of.

 The len field is the length of the valid data pointed to.

 There is also a const version of it when the data is const.

 A UsefulBuf is NULL, it has no value, when the ptr in it is NULL.

 There are only a few utility functions and macros associated with
 UsefulBuf.

 See also UsefulOutBuf. It is a richer structure that has both the
 size of the valid data and the size of the buffer.

 Struct is 16 or 8 bytes on a 64 or 32 bit machine so it can go on the
 stack and be a function parameter or return value.

 UsefulBuf is kind of like the Useful Pot Pooh gave Eeyore on his
 birthday. Eeyore's ballon fits beautifully, "it goes in and out like
 anything".

/**
 UsefulOutBuf is a structure and functions (an object) that are good
 for serializing data into a buffer such as is often done with network
 protocols or data written to files.

 The main idea is that all the pointer manipulation for adding data is
 done by UsefulOutBuf functions so the caller doesn't have to do any.
 All the pointer manipulation is centralized here.  This code will
 have been reviewed and written carefully so it spares the caller of
 much of this work and results in much safer code with much less work.

 The functions to add data to the output buffer always check the
 length and will never write off the end of the output buffer. If an
 attempt to add data that will not fit is made, an internal error flag
 will be set and further attempts to add data will not do anything.

 Basically, if you initialized with the correct buffer, there is no
 way to ever write off the end of that buffer when calling the Add
 and Insert functions here.

 The functions to add data do not return an error. The working model
 is that the caller just makes all the calls to add data without any
 error checking on each one. The error is instead checked after all the
 data is added when the result is to be used.  This makes the callers
 code cleaner.

 There is a utility function to get the error status anytime along the
 way if the caller wants. There are functions to see how much room is
 left and see if some data will fit too, but their use is generally
 not necessary.

 The generall calling flow is like this:

    - Initialize the UsefulOutBuf with the buffer that is to have the
      data added.  The caller allocates the buffer.  It can be heap
      or stack or shared memory (or other).

    - Make calls to add data to the output buffer. Insert and append
      are both supported. The append and insert calls will never write
      off the end of the buffer.

    - When all data is added, check the error status to make sure
      everything fit.

    - Get the resulting serialized data either as a UsefulBuf (a
      pointer and length) or have it copied to another buffer.

 UsefulOutBuf can be initialized with just a buffer length by passing
 NULL as the pointer to the output buffer. This is useful if you want
 to go through the whole serialization process to either see if it
 will fit into a given buffer or compute the size of the buffer
 needed. Pass a very large buffer size when callint Init, if you want
 just to compute the size.

 Some inexpensive simple sanity checks are performed before every data
 addtion to gaurd against use of an uninitialized or corrupted
 UsefulOutBuf.

 This has been used to create a CBOR encoder. The CBOR encoder has
 almost no pointer manipulation in it, is much easier to read, and
 easier to review.

 A UsefulOutBuf is 27 bytes or 15 bytes on 64 or 32 bit machines so it
 can go on the stack or be a C99 function parameter.

 NewData is the pointer and length for the bytes to be added to the
 output buffer. There must be room in the output buffer for all of
 NewData or an error will occur.

 The insertion point must be between 0 and the current valid data. If
 not an error will occur. Appending data to the output buffer is
 achieved by inserting at the end of the valid data. This can be
 retrieved by calling UsefulOutBuf_GetEndPosition().

 When insertion is performed, the bytes between the insertion point and
 the end of data previously added to the output buffer is slid to the
 right to make room for the new data.

 Overlapping buffers are OK. NewData can point to data in the output
 buffer.

 If an error occurs an error state is set in the UsefulOutBuf. No
 error is returned.  All subsequent attempts to add data will do
 nothing.

 Call UsefulOutBuf_GetError() to find out if there is an error. This
 is usually not needed until all additions of data are complete.

/**
 UsefulInBuf is the counterpart to UsefulOutBuf and is for parsing
 data read or received.  The idea is that you initialize with the data
 you got off the network and its length. Then you use the functions
 here to get the various data types out of it. It maintains a position
 for getting the next item. This means you don't have to track a
 pointer as you get each object. UsefulInBuf does that for you and
 makes sure it never goes off the end of the buffer.  The qcbor
 implementation parser makes use of this for all its pointer math and
 length checking.

 UsefulInBuf also maintains an intenal error state so you do not have
 to. Once data has been requested off the end of the buffer, it goes
 into an error state. You can keep calling functions to get more data
 but they will either return 0 or NULL. As long as you don't
 dereference the NULL, you can wait until all data items have been
 fetched before checking for the error and this can simplify your
 code.

 The integer parsing expects network byte order (big endian). Network
 byte order is what is used by TCP/IP, CBOR and most internet protocols.

 64-bit machine: 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 (5 bytes padding to align) = 32 bytes
 32-bit machine: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 (1 byte padding to align) = 16 bytes

/*
 Reliable correctness and avoidance of compiler warnings are the default
 for this code so that it works and can be use as-is with many CPUs, compilers
 and operating systems. It may not result in the smallest and fastest
 object code in every situation. The following two macros can be turned
 on to reduce size and increase speed.

 USEFULBUF_USE_HTON

 Use of htonX() and ntohX() is recommended and preferred, so turn this
 on if it is not too much trouble.  Typically the issue is that the name
 of the include file is not as expected.

 Turning this on will cause the best local implementation to be
 used.  For example on some x86 CPUs htonX() and ntohX() turn into the
 single bswap instruction inline with the calling code.

 htonX() and ntohX() can be counted on to behave correctly so, if it compiles
 it will work correctly.


 USEFULBUF_CONVERT_FLOAT_WITH_UNION

 This only affects floats and doubles. If they are not used, this doesn't
 matter.

 With this off, memcpy() is used to convert endian-correct integers to / from
 float and double. This is always correct and generates no compiler warnings.

 Most compilers will optimize the memcpy() into a move instruction which is
 quite efficient and good so there is usually no need to define this macro.

 If the compiler does not optimize like this, this macro can be defined to
 get the same result. However use of a union to convert from float to / from
 int is considered implementation defined behavior by the C standard. It is
 unlikely that a compiler would do the wrong thing, but it is not required
 that they do the right thing, hence this is optional.

 To determine if a compiler does the right thing, turn this on and see if
 the unit tests pass.
