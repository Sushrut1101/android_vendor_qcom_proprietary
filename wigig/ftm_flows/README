ftm_flows_test/main.c                       Test utility implementation

II. Compilation and Linkage on Android Platform
------------------------------------------------
Test utility application makefile may be used for reference - ftm_flows_test/Android.mk
Shared library name is "libwigig_ftm_flows"
No additional dependencies are needed
All exposed APIs are defined in a single header file - wigig_ftm_flows_impl.h

III. Android Platform Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------------
Shared library is expected to be installed in /vendor/lib64 folder, i.e. /vendor/lib64/libwigig_ftm_flows.so
If needed, the test utility is expected to be installed in /vendor/bin folder, i.e. /vendor/bin/ftm_flows_test

IV. Operating Instructions
---------------------------
1. Connection shall be established prior to first flow activation.
2. The connection should be released as part of a graceful shutdown.
3. This library is not reentrant and is intended to work simultaneously with a single WIGIG interface.
4. All flow APIs return zero on success or a negative error code.
   Textual description of the last error can be retrieved with 'wigig_ftm_flows_get_last_error' API.
5. When running test utility provide '-h' option to see a list of all supported operations and parameters,
   i.e. 'ftm_flows_test -h'

See test utility for reference code.

Note: Test utility is a CLI tool and so it initializes and releases the connection for each flow it runs.
      Real application should initialize connection only once before calling the first flow API and release
      it once after calling last flow API.

V. Logging
-----------
1. Library output is sent by default to the Syslog and can be redirected to the standard output with
   'wigig_ftm_flows_configure_output_sink' API. Supported output options are 'SYSLOG' and 'STDOUT'.
2. Only errors are reported by default to the selected output option.
   Verbose logging can be enabled with 'wigig_ftm_flows_configure_log_verbosity' API.
   'LOG_ALL' will allow warning, info and debug information be logged in addition to the errors.

Note: relevant Syslog content can be retrieved with 'logcat | grep _process_name_' command,
      where '_process_name_' is the name of process using (linked with) FTM Flows Library.

VI. Versioning
---------------
Library version can be retrieved with 'wigig_ftm_flows_get_version' API.
Version format is Major.Minor.Maintenance.Build
