A sample configuration file is provided (thermal-engine.conf_sample).

Description:
1) PID instance 'Test-PID' is running based on virtual-sensor-0 reading.
2) virtual-sensor-0 needs to be defined manually by users as [<virtual sensor name>]
3) trip_sensor is used to determine when virtual sensor polling mode will start.
4) trip_sensor has to be a regular sensor, cannot be another virtual sensor.
5) set_point is the threshold for trip sensor. When above this value, trip
   sensor will transition from interrupt mode to polling mode. The polling rate
   is based on the sampling number defined in [<virtual sensor name>] instance.
6) set_point_clr is the threshold for trip sensor. When below this value, trip
   sensor will stop polling mode and wait for next threshold event.
7) sensors define an array of regular sensors that virtual sensor requires to calculate
   the weighted temperature.
8) weights define an array of weighted value that corresponding to the array of sensors.
9) set_point of virtual sensor has to be less than the set_point for pid so that pid
   will get notification when set_point is reached. Otherwise, pid will not be able to
   know the temperature if virtual sensor doesn't start polling mode.
10)If trip sensor does not support changing from interrupt mode to polling mode,
   then 9) can be ignored. Virtual sensor will simply keep reading temperature
   every sampling period.

quadratic_reward     1
quadratic_penalty    1
use_timeout          0
timeout              1

Description:
1) debug indicates that debug logging output is enabled.
2) We are configuring CPU4 to be controlled by token bucket. This instance
   will monitor tsens_tz_sensor13 and control the frequency on cluster1,
   since algo_type is tb, sensor is tsens_tz_sensor13 and device is cluster1.
3) Temperature readings and subsequent frequency mitigation will occur every
   10ms since sampling is 10.
4) Temperature readings and subsequent frequency mitigation will begin when
   tsens_tz_sensor13 reaches 85000mC and will continue every 10ms until
   tsens_tz_sensor13 reaches 50000mC, since set_point is 85000 and
   set_point_clr is 50000.
5) time_constant is currently unused but is reserved for future use.
6) up_loop_gain set to 2 means that for every degree that tsens_tz_sensor13
   is below its set_point, the reward will increase by a factor of 2.
7) down_loop_gain set to 3 means that for every degree that tsens_tz_sensor13
   overshoots its set_point, the penalty will increase by a factor of 3.
8) auto_penalty of 1.0 means that the number of degrees of overshoot used
   to calculate penalty will always be incremented by 1.0. This means that at
   85C, the temperature overshoot will be 1C, 86C->2C, etc.
9) auto_reward of 0.0 means that the number of degrees of undershoot used to
   calculate the reward will not be augmented. This means that at 80C, the
   temperature undershoot will be 5C, 81C->4C, etc.
10) temp_scale_factor of 1000 means that the temperature readings from
   tsens_tz_sensor13 are received in mC and not C. This used to vary between
   tsens sensors and other types of sensors in the thermal-engine such as gen
   sensors.
11) freq_scale_factor of 1 means that the frequency readings from device1 are
   recieved in kHz. This varies between devices, for instance the GPU frequency
   readings on 8994 are received in Hz, and therefore the freq_scale_factor
   for the 8994 GPU is 1000.
12) quadratic_reward of 1 means to square the amount of reward. Whereas
   reward would normally be (undershoot * up_loop_gain), if this value is
   nonzero then reward is calculated as (undershoot * up_loop_gain)^2.
13) quadratic_penalty of 1 means to square the amount of penalty. Whereas
   penalty would normally be (overshoot * down_loop_gain), if this value is
   nonzero then penalty is calculated as (overshoot * down_loop_gain)^2.
14) use_timeout of 0 means that when the readings on tsens_tz_sensor13 reach
   their set_point_clr, the algorithm should immediately stop polling and
   stop mitigating. If this value were nonzero, then the algorithm would wait
   for timeout number of sequential interrupts (i.e. timeout * sampling ms)
   in which the reading from tsens_tz_sensor13 was below set_point_clr before
   ceasing to poll and mitigate.
