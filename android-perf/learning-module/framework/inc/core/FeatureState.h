 *   @brief   Feature State Machine class
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION
 *      FeatureState class provides a state machine implementation for the
 *   Features to use per app. The state machine forces some restrictions on the
 *   allowed state transitions and FeatureState can operate the states of apps
 *   within the allowed transitions.

/*
 * AppState is an enum to hold the state of the feature per app
 *
 * DATA_REQUIRED - Default Value: Features start each app in this Feature state
 *      it specifies meters have not run for this app and collected data required
 * DATA_COMPLETE - An app is moved to this Feature state when required
 *      data collection is completed. This state transition is generally expected
 *      to be done by the Metameter. This state is a prerequisite for Algorithm to
 *      start working on the data
 * EVAL_REQUIRED - Algorithm moves the app to this Feature State once it completes
 *      its run. This denotes the algorithm has completed but the output data
 *      needs to be evaluated through another set of evaluation data
 * EVAL_DATA_COMPLETE - Metameter is expected to provide the data for evaluation
 *      also. Metameter moves the app to this Feature State once the evaluation
 *      data collection is complete.
 * LEARNING_COMPLETE - Algorithm starts running again for evaluation of the output
 *      using the Evaluation data and moves to the app to this feature state once
 *      it decides that evaluation is success intending that learning is complete.
 * DISABLE_LEARNING - This state is used to disable learning for particular apps.
